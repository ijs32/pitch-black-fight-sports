  title: "Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)"
  content: '(BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting with the goal of gaining a dominant position and using joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit. The art was based on early 20th century Kodokan Judo, which was itself then a recently-developed system (founded in 1882), based on multiple schools (or Ryu) of Japanese Jujutsu.

  BJJ promotes the principle that a smaller, weaker person using leverage and proper technique can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger assailant. BJJ can be trained for self defense, sport grappling tournaments, and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition. Sparring (commonly referred to as "rolling") and live drilling play a major role in training. A premium is placed on performance, especially in competition.'
