  content: "Our fitness MMA program is designed with the everyday person in mind.  We have developed our program in a way that allows those who may not want to engage in the physical aspects of MMA i.e. sparring, wrestling, contact, to train like the MMA athletes of today.  Mixed Martial Artist's have some of the sharpest physiques in all sports and with discipline, focus, and hard work you can too.  Our experienced and trained coaches run circuit style classes with a variety of bag, strength, cardio, and sport conditioning. Heavy bag work, mitt work, and no contact allow you to learn basic kickboxing/Mixed Martial Arts and self defense skills without the risk of injuries that can sometimes go along sparring, wrestling,  BJJ, and crossfit.  Start your transformation today and let us help you be THE BEST YOU!"
